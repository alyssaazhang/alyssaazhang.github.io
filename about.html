      <p id="hi">Hey there! My name is Alyssa,</p>
      <p id="description">
        and I'm a dedicated student and aspiring data scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to contact me or view my
        resume <a id="resume" href="projects.html">here</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        <img class="me" src=img/me12.jpg> I'm currently in my
        <b>2A term of Computer Science</b> at the Unversity of Waterloo, seeking
        internships for <b>Fall 2021</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to leverage the power of data to drive
        decision-making, empower organizations and improve lives. From genomics
        to cinematography, I've always been fascinated by the prevalence and
        impact of data in any field. I am particularly interested in
        <b>data analysis</b>, <b>machine & deep learning</b>,
        <b>predictive modelling</b>, and <b>big data</b>, and I am always
        looking to learn more!
      </p>
      <p>
        Athletics have always been a huge part of who I am, and they've helped
        me approach all aspects of my life with <b>perseverance</b> and
        <b>mental strength</b>. Having to quit competitive swimming and train
        alone at public lane swims for 6 years has made me question my ability
        and motivation many times, but has also given me a deeper appreciation
        for <b>working hard and seeing it pay off </b>. Throughout high school as the
        swim team coach and volleyball team captain, I learned how to
        <b>lead with a focus on team goals</b>, but also realized the importance
        of <b>recogizing individual talents</b> for
        <b>stronger relationships and results</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this with the intention of making it my personal website, but
        I ended up turning it into a personal/photography crossover. Enjoy :)
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I love swimming, spending time with friends/family,
        baking, travelling, and (of course!) photography.
      </p>
